# Hello! Thanks for visiting my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

## About me:

ðŸ‘© I'm Dianne Gabriel, a developer with a previous background in marketing, graphic design, videography, and art. I'm a spontaneous and adventurous person who loves to travel around the world! I love being active, doing arts & crafts, playing board games, journaling, and many more!

## Why tech and coding?

ðŸ“‚ I got into the world of tech and programming languages as early as 10 years old. I clearly remember coding my very first HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project and immediately got hooked! I enjoyed the satisfaction of creating something from scratch and having the creative freedom over it.

ðŸ’» While tech wasn't my first choice as a career after high school, my passion and love for coding has always lived within me. Finally, after deciding to switch careers, I enrolled to Lighthouse Labs Full Stack Web Dev Bootcamp in 2021.

âœ¨ After finishing the extremely challenging bootcamp, I realized that I truly enjoy the process of creating apps and products that solve people's problems. I strive to make self-care, motivational, and meaningful products that assist people in their daily struggles.
