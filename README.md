### Hello! Thanks for visiting my GitHub.

#### A little bit about me:

##### I'm Dianne Gabriel, a developer with a previous background in marketing, graphic design, videography, and art.

##### Got into the world of tech and programming languages as early as 10 years old. I clearly remember coding my very first HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project and immediately got hooked!
