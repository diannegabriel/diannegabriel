## Hello! Thanks for visiting my GitHub.

### About me:

#### I'm Dianne Gabriel, a developer with a previous background in marketing, graphic design, videography, and art. I'm a spontaneous and adventurous person who's hoping to travel around the world! I love being active, doing arts & crafts, hanging out with friends, journaling, and many more!

### Why tech and coding?

#### Got into the world of tech and programming languages as early as 10 years old. I clearly remember coding my very first HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project and immediately got hooked! I enjoyed the satisfaction of creating something from scratch and having a creative freedom over it.

#### While tech wasn't my first choice as a career after high school, my passion and love for coding has always lived within me. Finally, after deciding to switch careers, I enrolled to Lighthouse Labs Full Stack Web Dev in 2021.
